<h2>About</h2>

<p>The API Model Canvas is based on Alex Osterwalder's work on the <a href="http://businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas/bmc">Business Model Canvas</a>. The original Business Model Canvas was changed by <a href="http://www.3scale.net">3scale</a> to reflect the specific nature and requirements of creating and running API Programs. It provides organizations an easy-to-follow methodology to set-up and run an API Program and focusses on the essential aspects.</p>
