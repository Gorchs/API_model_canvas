<h2>Developer Relations</h2>
<p>Having strong developer relations to drive adoption is a key element of an API program. After all, whatâ€™s the point of having an API if no one uses it? The developer relations field is more crucial for public API programs. But even if the API is private and only used by internal developers, they are still developers and have similar requirements. So, the function of developer relations can be adapted, but is still necessary for API adoption regardless of the locus of the API.</p>
<p>
This field describes the strategy and related tactics to achieve the developer-related objectives set in the strategy for the API. The targets are achieved via different means of communication such as social media and ideally the establishment of a community around the API.</p>
<p> 
Developer relations is also a human resource-oriented function. Employing developer evangelists is a very effective means to drive and shape developer relations.
