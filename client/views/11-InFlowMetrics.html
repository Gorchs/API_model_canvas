<h2>In-Flow Metrics</h2>
<p>The in-flow metrics are the value side of the equation. That expresses what you get for the investment in the cost field of the API Model Canvas. Depending on the revenue model of the API program this can be tricky and depends on what the organization aims to achieve with the API program as defined in the Strategy for the API and Objectives field of the API Model Canvas.</p>
<p>

If the API is monetized directly, then the generated revenues can be measured easily. However, there are other use cases and benefits from APIs as we discuss in the <a href="http://www.3scale.net/api-economy/ebooks/winning-in-the-api-economy/" target="_blank">Winning in the API Economy</a> ebook and in the article about <a href="http://www.3scale.net/2014/12/effective-api-programs-leveraging-api-benefits/" target="_blank">Leveraging API Benefits</a>. However, benefits like increasing reach, enhanced brand awareness, innovation or increased efficiencies are more difficult to measure. But still, the metrics - monetary or not - need to be measured in line with the strategy for the API, and then be compared to the costs to assess the effectiveness and value of the API Program.</p>
