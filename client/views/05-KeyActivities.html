<h2>Key Activities</h2>
<p>This field includes all activities that are required to successfully run the API program. That could include API operations, support, onboarding of new customers and developers, marketing, testing, extending the API, maintaining infrastructure, controlling and managing distribution channels, etc.</p>

<p>In order to get full visibility and control over your API, we strongly recommend API Management which includes features such as access control, usage policies (like rate limits), analytics, API documentation, developer portals, monetization and billing.
</p>

<p>
You can implement this yourself (ideally deploying open-source solutions so that you donâ€™t have to start completely from scratch) or you can choose one of the off-the-shelf API Management solutions - like ours from <a href="http://www.3scale.net/" target="_blank">3scale</a> - which are usually more cost-effective.
